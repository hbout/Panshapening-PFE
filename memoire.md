# Dedicace :
I dedicate this work first and foremost to my family, my parents and sister for their sacrifices, for always being there for always pushing me to be the best version of myself.
To my grandmother, and recently deceased aunt may allah have mercy on her soul for their prayers and their support.
To my friends for their support and for all the good times we have shared, be it in university or the dorms (CUB 1) or in the streets of Blida.
To Lamia my friend and my binome for sticking with me through thick and thin.
A special thought goes to my Atos who has been my faithful companion in all my travels.
